# AlgoForge 
## Visualize and Experiment with Machine Learning Algorithms
AlgoForge is your go-to tool for hands-on learning and experimentation with machine learning algorithms. Designed specifically for students and ML enthusiasts, this interactive platform allows you to visualize and tweak various machine learning models in real-time, providing a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work and how different parameters affect their performance.

##ðŸš€ Key Features:
Interactive Visualizations: Dive into dynamic visualizations of classification algorithms. See decision boundaries shift and data points transform as you adjust parameters.
Comprehensive Algorithm Suite: Explore practical implementations of popular algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Real-Time Parameter Tuning: Experiment with hyperparameters to see immediate effects on model performance and decision boundaries.
Educational Resources: Access sample datasets, instructional notebooks, and detailed explanations to enhance your learning experience.
